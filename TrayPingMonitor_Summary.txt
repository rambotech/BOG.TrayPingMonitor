Project: Bulk File Rename  (BOG.BulkFileRename)
Class: Small Utility
Author: John J Schultz   ( http://www.bitsofgenius.com )

Allows all or selected files within a folder to be renamed using one
of a variety of methods: root name prefix, root name suffix, extension
prefix, extension suffix, insert at a specific position, replace text
and remove text.

The app is launched directly, or via a command-line with the starting
folder as the sole parameter.

It is intended to work with large sets of files, which need to be
renamed with more complex rules than a simple name.
